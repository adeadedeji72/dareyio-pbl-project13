# Ansible Dynamic Assignments (Include) and Community Roles #

In this project we will introduce dynamic assignments by using include module.

Now you may be wondering, what is the difference between static and dynamic assignments?

Well, from Project 12, you can already tell that static assignments use import Ansible module. The module that enables dynamic assignments is include.

Hence,
~~~
import = Static
include = Dynamic
~~~

When the *import module* is used, all statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed. Meaning, when you execute site.yml playbook, Ansible will process all the playbooks referenced during the time it is parsing the statements. This also means that, during actual execution, if any statement changes, such statements will not be considered. Hence, it is static.

On the other hand, when *include module* is used, all statements are processed only during execution of the playbook. Meaning, after the statements are parsed, any changes to the statements encountered during execution will be used.

Take note that in most cases it is recommended to use static assignments for playbooks, because it is more reliable. With dynamic ones, it is hard to debug playbook problems due to its dynamic nature. However, you can use dynamic assignments for environment specific variables as we will be introducing in this project.

## Introducing Dynamic Assignment Into Our structure ##

Create a new branch named **dynamic** in the ansible-config-mgt repository
~~~
git branch dynamic-assignments
~~~
Create a new folder *dynamic-assignments* in the root on the repository.
Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it env-vars.yml. We will instruct site.yml to include this playbook later.

The create the tree in the repository:
~~~
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── inventory
│   └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── roles (optional folder)
    └──...(optional subfolders & files)
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
~~~    

Since we will be using the same Ansible to configure multiple environments, and each of these environments will have certain unique attributes, such as servername, ip-address etc., we will need a way to set values to variables per specific environment.

For this reason, we will now create a folder to keep each environment’s variables file. Therefore, create a new folder *env-vars*, then for each environment, create new YAML files which we will use to set variables.

Your layout should now look like this:

~~~
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── env-vars
    └── dev.yml
    └── stage.yml
    └── uat.yml
    └── prod.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
├── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
    └── webservers.yml
~~~    

**Notice three 3 things:

1.    We used include_vars syntax instead of include, this is because Ansible developers decided to separate different features of the module. From Ansible version 2.8, the include module is deprecated and variants of include_* must be used. These are:

   * include_role
   * include_tasks
   * include_vars

In the same version, variants of import were also introduced, such as:

   * import_role
   * import_tasks

2. We made use of a special variables { playbook_dir } and { inventory_file }. { playbook_dir } will help Ansible to determine the location of the running playbook, and from there navigate to other path on the filesystem. { inventory_file } on the other hand will dynamically resolve to the name of the inventory file being used, then append .yml so that it picks up the required file within the env-vars folder.
3. We are including the variables using a loop. with_first_found implies that, looping through the list of files, the first one found is used. This is good so that we can always set default values in case an environment specific env file does not exist.

### Update site.yml with dynamic assignments ###

Update site.yml file to make use of the dynamic assignment. **site.yml** should now look like this.
~~~
---
- hosts: all
- name: Include dynamic variables 
  tasks:
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml 
  include: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
  tags:
    - always

-  hosts: webservers
- name: Webserver assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/webservers.yml
~~~

### Community Roles ###

Now it is time to create a role for MySQL database – it should install the MySQL package, create a database and configure users. But why should we re-invent the wheel? There are tons of roles that have already been developed by other open source engineers out there. These roles are actually production ready, and dynamic to accomodate most of Linux flavours. With Ansible Galaxy again, we can simply download a ready to use ansible role, and keep going.

You can browse available community roles here

We will be using a MySQL role developed by geerlingguy.

Hint: To preserve your your GitHub in actual state after you install a new role – make a commit and push to master your ‘ansible-config-mgt’ directory. Of course you must have git installed and configured on Jenkins-Ansible server and, for more convenient work with codes, you can configure Visual Studio Code to work with this directory. In this case, you will no longer need webhook and Jenkins jobs to update your codes on Jenkins-Ansible server, so you can disable it – we will be using Jenkins later for a better purpose.

On Jenkins-Ansible server make sure that git is installed with git --version, then go to ‘ansible-config-mgt’ directory and run
~~~
git init
git pull https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git branch roles-feature
git switch roles-feature
~~~

Inside roles directory create your new MySQL role with ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql and rename the folder to mysql
~~~
mv geerlingguy.mysql/ mysql
~~~
Read README.md file, and edit roles configuration to use correct credentials for MySQL required for the tooling website.

Now it is time to upload the changes into your GitHub:
~~~
git add .
git commit -m "Commit new role files into GitHub"
git push https://<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
~~~
Now, if you are satisfied with your codes, you can create a Pull Request and merge it to main branch on GitHub.
